2. **.NET 8 RESTful API** ‚Äì Secure API endpoints integrating data and business logic.
3. **Azure Functions & Logic Apps** ‚Äì Automation and data orchestration.
4. **SQL Server** ‚Äì Relational data layer and KPI computation.
5. **Power BI & Application Insights** ‚Äì Data visualization and observability.

Data flows bidirectionally between Dynamics 365 and Azure components, ensuring continuous monitoring through Application Insights.

---

## üîê 6. Security & Compliance
- Authentication via **OAuth 2.0** and token-based authorization (JWT).
- Secrets and keys stored in **Azure Key Vault**.
- Data encryption at rest using **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)**.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) following least privilege principle.
- Compliance with **GDPR** and **Microsoft Security Baseline**.

## üß† 7. Integrations
| System | Direction | Technology |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| ERP (SAP or similar) | Bidirectional | Azure Logic Apps + REST API |
| E-commerce | Unidirectional | Webhooks + Azure Function |
| Helpdesk (Zendesk / Freshdesk) | Bidirectional | Service Bus + REST API |
| Power BI | Read-only | SQL Server + DirectQuery |

---

## üß™ 8. Testing Strategy
| Test Type | Tool | Objective |
|------------|-------|------------|
| Unit Tests | xUnit | Validate plugins and API components (‚â• 80% coverage). |
| Integration Tests | Postman / MSTest | Ensure data consistency across systems. |
| Load Tests | JMeter | Simulate concurrent access and stress scenarios. |
| UI Tests | Selenium | Validate custom CRM forms and workflows. |
| Security Tests | OWASP ZAP / Azure Defender | Detect vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. |

Automation pipeline integrates with GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps for continuous validation.
